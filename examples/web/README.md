# Instructions
## Preparation
You can build the browserified version of the TIC api by running:
```sh
$ npm run web
```
in the root directory of this repository. 

Then copy the file tic.web.js from the dist directory to the examples/web directory.

## Running
You can run the example by executing:
```sh
$ npm run serve
```
or by: 
```sh
$ node .\examples\web\serve.js
```

If you don't want to use node/npm you can copy the example's contents to any http web server.
