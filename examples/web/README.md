# TIC Web Example
With this example you can use TIC in the browser. You can read and write account information and get ratings for accounts.

The example is pure html/css/javascript and all requests are performed on the client side, so there's no server or nodejs needed.

## Preparation
You can build the browserified version of the TIC api by running:
```sh
$ npm run web
```
in the root directory of this repository. 

Then copy the file tic.web.js from the dist directory to the examples/web directory.

## Running
You can run the example by executing:
```sh
$ npm run web-example
```
or by just opening the index.html in a browser.

It's possible to serve this example with any http web server.
